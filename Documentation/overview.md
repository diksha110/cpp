Project Title: Drowsiness Detection System

Project Overview:
The Drowsiness Detection System is an application that detects whether a person is feeling drowsy while driving. It captures the video stream from the webcam and analyzes it using a deep learning model to detect whether the person’s eyes are closed or not. If the person’s eyes are closed for more than 10 seconds, the system will sound an alarm to alert the driver.

Technologies Used:

* Python
* OpenCV
* Keras
* Numpy
* Pygame

Installation:

* Clone the repository from Github
* Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt
* Download the Haar Cascade files for face, left eye and right eye detection and place them in the haar cascade files directory.
* Download a pre-trained deep learning model and place it in the models directory.
* Download the alarm sound file and place it in the project directory.

Usage:

* Run the drowsiness_detection.py file using the command "python drowsiness_detection.py"
* The application will start capturing the video stream from the webcam and analyzing it.
* If the person’s eyes are closed for more than 10 seconds, the system will sound an alarm to alert the driver.

Scope:
The scope of this project is to develop a system that can detect drowsiness in drivers in real-time, using machine learning algorithms. The system will be designed to capture real-time images or videos of drivers, and then process them to detect any signs of drowsiness, such as closing of eyes, head drooping, or yawning. This system can be installed in vehicles to improve road safety by alerting the driver or a central monitoring system if drowsiness is detected.

Abstract:
Driving while drowsy is a major cause of road accidents worldwide. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a system that can detect drowsiness in drivers in real-time, and alert them or a central monitoring system to prevent accidents. This project aims to develop such a system using machine learning algorithms.

Introduction:
Drowsiness is a state of feeling sleepy or fatigued, and it is a common problem among drivers, especially those who drive for long hours. Drowsiness can affect a driver's reaction time, decision-making ability, and attention span, leading to accidents on the road. Therefore, it is essential to develop a system that can detect drowsiness in drivers and alert them or a central monitoring system to prevent accidents.

Literature Survey:
Several studies have been conducted to develop systems that can detect drowsiness in drivers. One approach is to use machine learning algorithms to analyze facial expressions and detect signs of drowsiness, such as eye closure, head drooping, and yawning. These studies have shown promising results in detecting drowsiness accurately.

Methodology:
The methodology for this project involves capturing real-time images or videos of drivers using a camera. The images or videos will then be processed using machine learning algorithms to detect signs of drowsiness, such as eye closure, head drooping, or yawning. The machine learning algorithms used for this project are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV.

Implementation:
The implementation of this project involves using the Python programming language and its libraries, such as Tensorflow, Keras, and OpenCV. The first step is to collect a dataset of images or videos of drivers displaying signs of drowsiness. This dataset will be used to train the CNN model to recognize drowsiness accurately. After training the model, it will be tested on new images or videos to evaluate its accuracy in detecting drowsiness.

System Design:
The system design for this project involves capturing real-time images or videos of drivers using a camera, which will be connected to a computer or a microcontroller. The images or videos will be processed using machine learning algorithms to detect signs of drowsiness, such as eye closure, head drooping, or yawning. If drowsiness is detected, the system will alert the driver or a central monitoring system to prevent accidents.

Algorithms:
The algorithms used for this project are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV. CNN is a deep learning algorithm that is widely used for image classification tasks. It is used in this project to recognize signs of drowsiness accurately. OpenCV is a computer vision library that is used for image processing tasks. It is used in this project to capture images or videos of drivers and process them to detect signs of drowsiness.
